## `fossa test`

The test command checks whether the most-recent scan of your FOSSA project raised license-policy or vulnerability issues. This command is usually run immediately after `fossa analyze`

- If there are issues, it prints them to stdout and fails with an exit code of 1
- If there are no issues, it prints nothing and succeeds with an exit code of 0

`fossa test` supports the [Common FOSSA Project Flags](#common-fossa-project-flags) supported by all commands

### Specifying a timeout

By default, `fossa test` waits a maximum of 10 minutes for issue scan results. To override the default timeout, use, e.g.:

```sh
fossa test --timeout 60
```

Where `60` is the maximum number of seconds to wait for issue scan results.

### Print issues as JSON

By default, `fossa test` displays issues in a human-readable format. To instead print issues as JSON, use:

```sh
fossa test --json
```
