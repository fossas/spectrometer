## Quick Start

Spectrometer is a tool that requires minimal configuration: usually, only a FOSSA API key is required.

If you do not have an API key, please check the [FOSSA documentation](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/api-reference) for instructions on generating an API key.

**Configure your API key**

```sh
export FOSSA_API_KEY=abcdef123456
```

**Run Analysis**

This runs dependency analysis in the current directory, uploading results to FOSSA

```sh
fossa analyze
```

**Check for FOSSA scan results**

```sh
fossa test
```

For additional commands and command flags, use `--help`:
```sh
fossa --help
fossa analyze --help
# etc
```

## `fossa analyze`

By default, the analyze command:

- looks for projects in the current directory (and recursively in subdirectories)
- extracts dependency graphs from those projects
- infers a project name, branch, and revision for the project (from git or svn)
- uploads the dependency graphs to FOSSA

For supported command-line flags, use `fossa analyze --help`

### Specifying FOSSA project details

In addition to the [usual FOSSA project flags](#common-fossa-project-flags) supported by all commands, the analyze command supports the following FOSSA-project-related flags:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--title 'some title'` | Set the title of the FOSSA project |
| `--branch 'some branch'` | Override the detected FOSSA project branch |
| `--project-url 'https://example.com'` | Add a URL to the FOSSA project |
| `--jira-project-key 'some-key'` | Add a Jira project key to the FOSSA project |
| `--link 'https://example.com'` | Attach a link to the current FOSSA build |
| `--team 'some team'` | Specify a team within your FOSSA organization |
| `--policy 'some policy'` | Assign a specific FOSSA policy to this project |

### Printing results without uploading to FOSSA

The `--output` flag can be used to print projects and dependency graph information to stdout, rather than uploading to FOSSA

```sh
fossa analyze --output
```

### Running in a specific directory

```sh
fossa analyze path/to/directory
```

### Scanning archive contents

With the `--unpack-archives` flag present, we unpack discovered archives to a temporary directory for dependency analysis. We recursively unpack archives-in-archives.

```sh
fossa analyze --unpack-archives
```

We support the following archive formats:

- `.zip`
- `.tar`
- `.tar.gz`
- `.jar`
- `.rpm`

### Manually specifying dependencies

FOSSA offers a way to manually upload dependencies provided we support the dependency type. Manually specifying dependencies is very helpful in the event your package manager is unsupported or you are using a custom and nonstandard dependency management solution.

The FOSSA CLI will automatically read `fossa-deps.yaml` in the root directory when `fossa analyze` is run and parse dependencies from it.

> Tip: Use a script to generate this file before running `fossa analyze` to keep your results updated.

```yaml
dependencies:
- type: gem
  package: iron
- type: pip
  package: Django
  version: 2.1.7
```
The `package` and `type` fields are required and specify the name of the dependency and where to find it. The `version` field is optional and specifies the preferred version of dependency.

Supported dependency types:
- `cargo` - Rust dependencies that a typically found at [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
- `carthage` - Dependencies as specified by the [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) package manager.
- `composer` - Dependencies specified by the PHP package manager [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), which are located on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).
- `gem` - Dependencies which can be found at [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/).
- `git` - Github projects (which appear as dependencies in many package managers). Specified as the full github repository `https://github.com/fossas/spectrometer`.
- `go` - Golang specific dependency. Many golang dependencies are located on Github, but there are some which look like the following `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver` that have custom golang URLs.
- `hackage` - Haskell dependencies found at [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/).
- `hex` - Erlang and Elixir dependencies that are found at [Hex.pm](https://hex.pm/).
- `maven` - Maven dependencies that can be found at many different sources. Specified as `package: javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api` where the convention is `groupId:artifactId`.
- `npm` - Javascript dependencies found at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- `nuget` - .NET dependencies found at [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/).
- `python` - Python dependencies found at [Pypi.org](https://pypi.org/).
- `cocoapods` - Swift and Objective-C dependencies found at [Cocoapods.org](https://cocoapods.org/).
- `url` - The URL type allows you to specify only the download location of a compressed file in the `package` field and the FOSSA backend will attempt to download and scan it. Example for a Maven dependency `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/aero/m-click/mcpdf/0.2.3/mcpdf-0.2.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. The `version` field will be ignored for `url` type dependencies.

## `fossa test`

The test command checks whether the most-recent scan of your FOSSA project raised license-policy or vulnerability issues. This command is usually run immediately after `fossa analyze`

- If there are issues, it prints them to stdout and fails with an exit code of 1
- If there are no issues, it prints nothing and succeeds with an exit code of 0

`fossa test` supports the [Common FOSSA Project Flags](#common-fossa-project-flags) supported by all commands

### Specifying a timeout

By default, `fossa test` waits a maximum of 10 minutes for issue scan results. To override the default timeout, use, e.g.:

```sh
fossa test --timeout 60
```

Where `60` is the maximum number of seconds to wait for issue scan results.

### Print issues as JSON

By default, `fossa test` displays issues in a human-readable format. To instead print issues as JSON, use:

```sh
fossa test --json
```

## `fossa report`

The report command downloads a report of the most-recent scan of your FOSSA project. This command is usually run immedately after `fossa analyze` or `fossa test`

The report type **must** be specified to successfully run, for example:

```sh
fossa report attribution
```

`fossa report` supports the [Common FOSSA Project Flags](#common-fossa-project-flags) supported by all commands.

### Report types

* `fossa report attribution` - A report that contains information about your dependencies and their authors. For more info about attributions, check the [FOSSA docs page illustrating the topic](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/generating-reports).

### Specifying a timeout

By default, `fossa report` waits a maximum of 10 minutes for report contents. To override the default timeout, use, e.g.:

```sh
fossa report attribution --timeout 60
```

Where `60` is the maximum number of seconds to wait for the report to be downloaded.

### Print report as JSON

By default, `fossa report` displays issues in a human-readable format. To instead print issues as JSON, use:

```sh
fossa report attribtion --json
```

*NOTE: Currently, text reports are not supported, and the report will be*
*printed as JSON.  It is reccommended to use the `--json` flag anyway, since*
*the behavior of the command without the flag will change in the future.*

## Common FOSSA Project Flags

All `fossa` commands support the following FOSSA-project-related flags:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--project 'some project'` | Override the detected project name |
| `--revision 'some revision'` | Override the detected project revision |
| `--fossa-api-key 'my-api-key'` | An alternative to using the `FOSSA_API_KEY` environment variable to specify a FOSSA API key |
| `--endpoint 'https://example.com'` | Override the FOSSA API server base URL |

## Frequently-Asked Questions

### `fossa analyze`: Why wasn't my project found?

If your project wasn't found, make sure you meet the requirements in the [relevant language/build-tool's quick reference](#supported-languages)

If your project meets the requirements, it's very likely `fossa analyze` found your project, but dependency analysis failed. To show the failure reason, use the `--debug` flag:

```sh
fossa analyze --debug
```

Note that the output is likely to be very noisy: our project discovery process is very lenient, and can produce many false-positives. False-positive projects almost always fail during the dependency analysis step, so we don't show analysis failures by default.

If your project wasn't in the `--debug` output, or you believe you've encountered a bug, please [file a bug](https://github.com/fossas/spectrometer/issues/new).

In your bug report, please include:

- relevant package manifest files (e.g., `pom.xml` or `package.json`)
- the output of `fossa analyze --debug`

### When are you adding support for (some buildtool/language)?

If we don't support your choice of language/buildtool, please [open an issue](https://github.com/fossas/spectrometer/issues/new) to express interest
