# Bad operator, will ignore version
BuildRequires: xz >> 1.2.3

# Lots of spaces, should be fine
BuildRequires:   libxml2     >=   5.4.98

# Complex version text (shouldn't change behavior)
BuildRequires:  gmock = 1.6.0-1.aapps.el7

# Ignored due to macro use
BuildRequires:  cloudistics-core%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

# Ignored for now, we don't check "Requires"
