-- | The Diagnostics effect is a replacement for the Error effect in most cases. It models an unchecked exceptions pattern, and provides for:
--
-- - "stack trace"-like behavior, closely resembling the golang pattern of errors.Wrap (see: 'context')
--
-- - recovery from failures, recording them as "warnings" (see: 'recover' or '<||>')
