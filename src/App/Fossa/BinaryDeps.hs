-- | Binary detection is sufficiently different from other analysis types that it cannot be just another strategy.
-- Instead, binary detection is run separately over the entire scan directory, outputting its own source unit.
-- The goal of this feature is to enable a FOSSA user to flag all vendored binaries (as defined by git) in the project as dependencies.
-- Users may then use standard FOSSA UX flows to ignore or add license information to the detected binaries.
